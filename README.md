# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

I created this calendar to help others keep track of their schedules with an easy to use interface. It is a tool for everyday use to quickly sketch out a schedule for the day that can be consulted throughout the day even if you close it. It can be changed for unexpected changes or just to type in a new day's schedule.

I further increased my understanding of how to use jQuery and referencing elements from the html. I also was able to get a better sense of how to utilize local storage and finding more efficient ways of coding those pieces in. While jQuery was a little challenging at first to understand, I eventually was able to better get a sense of its patterns and syntax.

Once you open the website, you will see time slots and save buttons next to them.

In these time slots you can type in what you will do in these hours. It can help keep track of those tasks in local storage.

If you open these in Application and Console log, you can see it is saved in local storage. When the information is refreshed, the information will stay in the time slot until you decided to change it and save different information.

Your newly entered information after you save it is now in local storage and will be there for the next refresh.

## Credits

My thanks to my tutor Andrew Hardemon who was able to help me fine tune certain pieces of the code, especially pertaining to local storage. He as always, was immensely helpful in helping me trouble-shoot all the places I got stuck in or when chatGPT wasn't particularly forthcoming with answers I needed. I also want to thank the TAs Tom Gold and Jaytee Padilla for sitting with me during office hours and helping me fix bugs in my code and suggesting better ways in creating my code.
